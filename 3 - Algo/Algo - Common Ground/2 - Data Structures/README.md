# Data Structures

Part 1: Asymtotic notations, Arrays and Sorting (if you fell you already know the material, only skim through it)

A. Read about asymptotic notations in IA p.43-49 (Only if your'e not familiar with the idea!)

B. Read about arrays and insertion sorting in AI p.16-29

C. Read abount Divide-and-Conquer methods and merge sorting in AI p.29-37


Part 2: Basic Data Structures

A. Read introduction in IA p.229-231

B. Read about the next data structures and do the given exercises:
	1. Stack/Queue - IA p. 232-253.
	2. Linked list - IA p. 236-240.
	3. Binary search tree - IA p. 286-298.
	4. Heap (and heap sort and priority queue) - IA p. 151-166.
	5. Hash table - IA p.253-264.
	
C. Final DAST exercise + timeit

Part 3: Advanced Data Structures

You are given two problems that have difficulties with the basic data structures you just read about.
For every problem, read online and find a better data structure to deal with the problem. Read about the data struture and find out the running time
of the main operations that can be performed on it. If there are several fitting data structures in your opinion, compare them.

1. add another problems

2. You are currently working for WAZE and help them improve the app. The upcoming new feature you develop will help user to find the
closest gas station to their current location.
You have a data about the locations of all the gas service stations over a 2D map. what is the best data dtucture to store them?
